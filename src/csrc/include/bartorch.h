 * The solve `pics` runs, assembled from here.
 *
 * `pics` turns its arguments into proximal operators, an algorithm and an
 * encoding, and hands the three to `lsqr2`.  This does the same with the same
 * BART functions -- `opt_reg_configure`, `italgo_config`, `lsqr2` -- so that
 * an operator built by the host and solved through here is the tool's own
 * computation rather than a second one that resembles it.
 *
 * A regularization term is named rather than spelled: `reg_kinds[i]` is the
 * letter `pics -R` uses for it and the arrays beside it are what that term's
 * specification carries -- the axes it works over, the axes it joins, its
 * weight, and the count an NIHT term takes.  They fill the table BART's own
 * parser would have filled, so what `opt_reg_configure` builds from them is
 * what it builds for the tool.
 * `algorithm` is one of "cg", "ist", "fista", "admm", "pridu", "niht", or
 * NULL to let BART choose as it does for the tool.
 * A negative `step` or fista parameter leaves BART its own default, which for
 * the proximal-gradient iterations is the 0.95 `pics` settles on.  `cclambda`
 * is the weight in the normal equations, which is `pics -q`; the regularizers'
 * own weights are theirs, and `pics -r` is a term (`-R Q`) rather than a knob.
 * `sigma_tau_ratio` balances the primal and dual steps of PRIDU, and is the
 * scaling the caller divided the data by: `pics` sets it from the scaling it
 * estimated for itself, so an assembled reconstruction that scales its own
 * data has to say by how much.
 * `cg_tol` is the tolerance of conjugate gradients, which `italgo_config`
 * leaves at BART's default of zero; the other iterations ignore it.
 * `admm_dynamic_rho`, `admm_dynamic_tau`, `admm_relative_norm` and
 * `admm_fast` are the rest of `struct admm_conf`: Boyd's penalty adaptation
 * and Wohlberg's residual balancing, the residuals it balances taken relative
 * to their scalings, and the mode that skips computing them at all.  What
 * `italgo_config` does not take -- the over-relaxation, `mu`, `tau_max` and
 * the two tolerances -- is out of reach from here and reachable only from the
 * iteration written in Python.
 * `iterations`, when given, is filled with the steps the algorithm took --
 * every one of BART's calls `iter_monitor` once a step, so counting those
 * counts them.  For conjugate gradients that is the number an
