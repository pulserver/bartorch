/*
 * BART's NUFFT operator, computed by FINUFFT.
 *
 * The seam is `nufft_create` rather than the gridding kernel underneath it:
 * FINUFFT does the spreading, the FFT and the deapodisation together, so none
 * of the three has to agree with BART's, only the sign and the scaling, which
 * tests pin against a discrete Fourier sum.
 *
 * `nufft.c` is compiled with its entry points renamed, so BART's own operator
 * is still there as `bart_nufft_*` and serves whatever this declines: a
 * subspace basis, weights that do not lie along k-space, a trajectory that
 * varies across frames, or no FINUFFT at all.
