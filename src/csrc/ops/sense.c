/*
 * The SENSE operators, with the coil loop inside them.
 *
 * BART builds these as two operators chained: the sensitivities as one
 * multiply-accumulate over every coil at once, then the transform over every
 * coil at once.  Everything between them is the size of the coil images, and
 * so is everything the Toeplitz normal allocates behind a non-Cartesian
 * transform -- the doubled grid it convolves on is `coils x 2^d x image`, one
 * block.  On a three-dimensional problem that is what decides whether a
 * reconstruction fits on a card at all.
 *
 * The coils are independent until the sum that ends the adjoint, so these
 * walk them a slab at a time: the sensitivities of that slab are applied, the
 * transform is asked for that slab, and the slab is summed into the answer.
 * What is resident is a slab rather than a bank, and the transform is built
 * for a slab, so its own working grid shrinks with it.
 *
 * The slab is a whole coil or several, because a transform of one coil is not
 * a transform of eight at an eighth of the cost: FINUFFT batches its plan
 * across transforms and a slab of one gives that up.  What the slab costs in
 * throughput and saves in memory is the whole trade, and it is a setting.
 *
 * A pattern or a basis laid out along the coils, or sensitivities that do not
 * carry the coils the images do, is not something this arrangement can serve;
 * those go back to BART's own chain, which the rename leaves reachable.
