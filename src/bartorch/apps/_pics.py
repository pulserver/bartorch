    The pipeline BART's ``pics`` command runs, assembled here: the

    convention BART iterates in, the scaling estimated from what is left, and
    then an encoding from :mod:`bartorch.linop` under an iteration from
    :mod:`bartorch.optim`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kspace : torch.Tensor
        Under-sampled k-space, C order: ``(coils, z, y, x)`` on a grid, and
        ``(coils, *encoding, shots, samples)`` off it.
    sensitivities : torch.Tensor
        Coil sensitivities, as :func:`~bartorch.tools.ecalib` produces them.
    regularizers : Regularizer or iterable of Regularizer, default=None
        :mod:`bartorch.priors` terms.  Their axes index the image's shape.
    l2 : float, default=None
        Plain Tikhonov weight.
    solver : {'cg', 'ist', 'fista', 'admm', 'pridu', 'niht'}, default=None
        ``None`` chooses from the terms, as the application does.  IST and
        FISTA apply a term's proximal operator to the image, so a first term
        over a transform -- :class:`~bartorch.priors.FourierL1`,
        :class:`~bartorch.priors.Laplace` -- for which the application
        chooses FISTA is refused here; ``'admm'`` and ``'pridu'`` take it.
        ``'niht'`` is the normalized iterative hard thresholding the
        application chooses for the hard-thresholding terms
        :class:`~bartorch.priors.WaveletNIHT` and
        :class:`~bartorch.priors.ImageNIHT`.
    maxiter : int, default=None
        Iterations; BART's default is thirty.
    step : float, default=None
        Step size for the gradient iterations.
    admm_rho : float, default=None
        ADMM penalty; setting it selects ADMM unless ``solver`` says otherwise.
    cg_maxiter : int, default=None
        Inner conjugate-gradient steps for ADMM.
    traj : torch.Tensor, default=None
        Non-Cartesian trajectory, in grid units.
    pattern : torch.Tensor, default=None
        Sampling pattern or weights; on a grid it is read off ``kspace`` when
        it is not given.
    basis : torch.Tensor, default=None
        Subspace basis over frames and coefficients.
    initial : torch.Tensor, default=None
        An image to start the iteration from, in the units the solve works in
        -- that is, already divided by ``scaling``.  ``pics -W`` reads it the
        same way: it rescales the warm start only under ``-S``, where the
        answer is put back into the data's units at the end.
    eigen_step : bool, default=False
        Take the step size from the largest eigenvalue of the normal operator
        rather than from ``step``, estimated by thirty power iterations as
        ``pics -e`` estimates it.  The starting vector comes from BART's
        process-global generator, so this is the one setting under which two
        runs in a process do not agree to the bit.
    toeplitz : bool, default=None
        ``False`` applies the encoding and its adjoint rather than the normal
        operator's convolution.
    scaling : float, default=None
        The data scaling to divide by; estimated when it is not given, which
        is what makes a regularization weight transferable.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The reconstructed image.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> image = pics(kspace, maps, l2=0.01, maxiter=50)
    >>> image = pics(kspace, maps, regularizers=priors.Wavelet((-1, -2), 0.005))
