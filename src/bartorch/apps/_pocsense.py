    The pipeline of BART's POCSENSE application, assembled here: the

    k-space, the modulation into the convention BART iterates in, and then a
    sweep of three projections from :mod:`bartorch.linop` and
    :mod:`bartorch.priors` under :class:`bartorch.optim.POCS`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kspace : torch.Tensor
        Under-sampled k-space, C order ``(coils, z, y, x)``.
    sensitivities : torch.Tensor
        Coil sensitivities, normalized, as :func:`~bartorch.tools.ecalib`
        produces them.
    maxiter : int, default=None
        Sweeps of the projections; BART's default is fifty.
    alpha : float, default=0.0
        Regularization weight.  Zero leaves the sparsity projection out
        entirely, as the application does, and the sweep is then the two
        projections onto the data and onto the coils.
    wavelet : bool, default=False
        Threshold the wavelet coefficients of the coil images rather than
        shrinking the samples towards zero, which is the application's ``-l 1``.
    robust : float, default=None
        Soft-threshold the residual at a measured position by this much
        rather than discarding it, which is the application's ``-o``.
    scaling : float, default=None
        The data scaling to divide by; estimated when it is not given, and
        the answer is put back into the data's units either way.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Coil k-space, in the centred convention, of ``kspace``'s shape.  The
        image is the coil combination of its inverse transform.

    Examples
    --------
