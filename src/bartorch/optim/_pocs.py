class POCSBlock(nn.Module):
    """One sweep of the projections, ``italgos.c``'s ``pocs``.

    Every projection is applied in turn, in place, and the sweep is the whole
    of a step: ``pocs`` takes no step size, keeps no momentum and reads no
    residual, so the state is the iterate alone.  Repeating the sweep is the
    method, which is what :class:`POCS` does.

    The projections carry the data and the encoding -- ``pocsense``'s are the
    measured samples, the range of the coil sensitivities and a sparsity
    threshold -- so ``A`` is not read.  It is accepted, and ignored, so that
    the block has the calling convention the others have and
    :class:`bartorch.learning.Unrolled` can stack it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    projections : sequence
        The sets to project onto, applied in the order given.  Each is a
        callable mapping a tensor to a tensor, or a :mod:`bartorch.priors`
        term, which is taken as its proximal operator at ``mu = 1``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> block = POCSBlock([consistency, sense, sparsity])
    >>> state = block.start(kspace)
    >>> state = block(state)
    >>> block.output(state)
