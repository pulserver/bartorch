class Tikhonov:
    """A quadratic penalty ``weight * ||operator x - bias||^2``.

    Generalized Tikhonov regularization, minimized by :class:`CG` alongside the
    data-fidelity term.  Without an operator the penalty is on the image
    itself; without a bias it penalizes the norm rather than the distance from
    a reference.

    Every combination remains a linear least-squares problem and is solved by
    conjugate gradients: the terms are stacked beneath the encoding, and the
    normal operator of the stack is the sum of the parts' normals, so a
    Toeplitz encoding keeps its point spread function convolution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weight : float
        The weight, not its square root.  Must not be negative.
    operator : LinearOperator, default=None
        What the penalty is on, mapping the image somewhere.  By default the
        image itself.
    bias : tensor, default=None
        What the penalty pulls towards, of the operator's codomain shape.  By
        default zero, which is the ordinary penalty on size.

    Examples
    --------
    Pull towards a prior image rather than towards zero:

    >>> CG(terms=Tikhonov(0.1, bias=prior))(y, A)

    Penalize the first differences, which is quadratic total variation:

    >>> CG(terms=Tikhonov(0.1, operator=linop.Gradient(A.ishape, (-1, -2))))(y, A)

    Without terms the problem is

    .. math::

    the ordinary Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem.  With terms it
    is

    .. math::

        \min_x \; \| A x - y \|^2 + \lambda \| x \|^2
              + \sum_i w_i \| G_i x - b_i \|^2

    still a linear least-squares problem and so still this iteration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lambda_ : float, default=0.0
        Tikhonov weight on the image itself, added to the normal operator.
    terms : Tikhonov or iterable of Tikhonov, default=None
        Quadratic penalties with an operator, a bias, or both.  See
        :class:`Tikhonov`.
    maxiter : int, default=30
    tol : float, default=0.0
        Stop once the residual of the normal equations is at most
        ``tol * ||A^H y||``.  Zero, BART's default, runs every iteration.
    cclambda : float, default=0.0
        Weight of an identity added to the normal operator.
    precond : LinearOperator, default=None
        Left preconditioner, ``lsqr2_create``'s ``precond_op``: chained onto
        the normal operator and onto the adjoint, so the iteration sees
        ``M(A^H A + lambda) x = M A^H y``.  Must be positive definite --
        BART composes it without symmetrizing.  BART's own reconstructions
        pass none.

    Notes
    -----
    BART's conjugate gradients takes one weight and nothing else:
    ``iter2_conjgrad`` asserts that it is handed no regularizing operators and
    no biases, and ``lsqr2_create`` builds ``A^H A + lambda I``.  So the terms
    are not passed to it -- they are built into the operator it is given, by
    stacking them under the encoding.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> CG(maxiter=30)(kspace, A)
    >>> CG(terms=Tikhonov(0.1, bias=prior))(kspace, A)
    >>> CG(terms=[Tikhonov(0.1, operator=G), Tikhonov(0.01)])(kspace, A)

class ADMM(_Solver):
    """Alternating direction method of multipliers, looping :class:`ADMMBlock`.

    Parameters

        Terms with auxiliary variables -- total generalized
        variation and the two infimal convolutions -- walk the image and the
        fields behind it.
    maxiter : int, default=30
        A budget on conjugate-gradient iterations across the whole run, not a
        count of outer steps: ``admm`` breaks when ``nr_invokes > maxiter``.
        Thirty with ten inner iterations is about five outer steps.
    rho : float, default=0.5
        Penalty parameter; BART's default is 0.5.
    cg_maxiter : int, default=10
        Conjugate-gradient iterations per x-update; BART's default is 10.
    hogwild : bool, default=False
        BART's ``hogwild`` setting, which doubles ``rho`` after
        ten steps, then twenty, then forty.  Not combinable with
        ``dynamic_rho``, which BART asserts against.
    cclambda : float, default=0.0
        Weight of an identity added to the normal operator.
    biases : sequence of tensor, default=None
        The ``b_j`` of ``f_j(G_j x - b_j)``, one per term, each of its term's
        transformed shape.
    dynamic_rho : bool, default=False
        Move ``rho`` with the residuals: up by
        ``tau`` when the primal residual leads, down when the dual does.  The
        dual variables are rescaled to match, so the split stays where it was.
    dynamic_tau : bool, default=False
        Choose ``tau`` from the residuals too,
        as ``sqrt(r / s)`` clipped to ``[1 / tau_max, tau_max]``.  Together
        with ``dynamic_rho`` and ``relative_norm`` this is the residual
        balancing of Wohlberg (2017).
    relative_norm : bool, default=False
        Compare the residuals to their scalings rather than to each other.
    fast : bool, default=False
        Skip the residuals entirely, and with them the stopping test.
    alpha : float, default=1.6
        Over-relaxation; BART's default is 1.6.
    mu : float, default=3.0
        How far the residuals must part before ``dynamic_rho`` moves ``rho``.
    tau_max : float, default=20.0
        The clip on ``tau``.
    abstol, reltol : float, default=0.0
        Boyd's absolute and relative tolerances, which stop the iteration when
        both residuals are inside them.  ``italgo_config`` sets both to zero,
        so only the iteration budget stops the run.
    cg_maxiter_first : int, default=None
        A separate budget for the first step's inner solve, where there is no
        warm start to build on; riesling's, not BART's.
    precond : LinearOperator, default=None
        Left preconditioner, ``lsqr2_create``'s ``precond_op``: chained onto
        the normal operator and onto the adjoint, so the iteration sees
        ``M(A^H A + lambda) x = M A^H y``.  Must be positive definite --
        BART composes it without symmetrizing.  BART's own reconstructions
        pass none.

    Notes
    -----
    ``italgo_config`` has no way to pass ``alpha``, ``mu``, ``tau_max``, the
    tolerances, the biases or ``cg_maxiter_first``, so BART's own loop cannot
    be given them.

class PRIDU(_Solver):
    """Primal-dual iteration, looping :class:`PRIDUBlock`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regularizers : Regularizer or ImplicitPrior, or an iterable of them, default=None
        Terms with auxiliary variables extend the optimization variable; the
        step spans the image and the auxiliary fields behind it, as in
        :class:`ADMM`.
    maxiter : int, default=30
    step : float, default=0.95
        Step size.
    sigma_tau_ratio : float, default=1.0
        Ratio of the dual to the primal step: ``sigma = sqrt(step) * ratio``,
        ``tau = sqrt(step) / ratio``.  BART's own reconstructions set it to
        the factor the data was divided by, so pass :func:`data_scaling`'s
        value to match them.
    adaptive_step : bool, default=False
        Adapt the steps during the iteration.
    eigen : bool, default=False
        Scale the step by the largest eigenvalue of the normal operator,
        estimated with 30 power iterations.
    hogwild : bool, default=False
        Decay the steps by a factor of 0.95 per iteration.
    cclambda : float, default=0.0
        Weight of an identity added to the normal operator.
    precond : LinearOperator, default=None
        Left preconditioner, ``lsqr2_create``'s ``precond_op``: chained onto
        the normal operator and onto the adjoint, so the iteration sees
        ``M(A^H A + lambda) x = M A^H y``.  Must be positive definite --
        BART composes it without symmetrizing.  BART's own reconstructions
        pass none.
