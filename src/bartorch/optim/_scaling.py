    """Normalization factor for the data of a reconstruction.

    Dividing the data by it makes a regularization weight independent of the
    data's overall scale, and is the normalization BART's own reconstructions
    apply before solving.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : torch.Tensor
        Data as the solve will see it: for a Cartesian encoding, after the
        sampling pattern and ``fftmod(..., inverse=True)``.  Coils must be on
        their own axis in BART's layout rather than the squeezed layout an
        operator takes, because the estimate is read off the k-space centre and
        a misplaced coil axis moves it.
    A : LinearOperator, default=None
        The encoding.  With one, the estimate used for a non-Cartesian
        acquisition: the spread of ``|A^H y|`` from its order statistics.
        Without one, the k-space-centre estimate BART's ``estscaling``
        makes, used for a Cartesian acquisition.
    percentile : float, default=None
        Take this percentile of the sorted magnitudes instead of BART's
        rule.
    compat : bool, default=False
        Take the median, as BART's older estimate did.  Only with ``A``.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The scaling.  Zero means the estimate failed, and a scaling of one
        should be used instead.

    Notes
    -----
    Without ``A`` the estimate is BART's ``estimate_scaling``: the
    root-sum-of-squares image of the fully sampled central region of k-space,
    at most 32 samples along each axis, corrected for the region's size, and the
    90th percentile of its voxel magnitudes -- or their maximum, when the
    maximum exceeds the 90th percentile by at least twice the difference
    between the 90th percentile and the median.  With ``A`` the same rule is
    applied to the magnitudes of ``A^H y``.

    The solution of a solve on scaled data is divided by the same factor;
    multiplying it by the scaling puts it back into the units of the data, as
    ``pics -S`` and :func:`bartorch.apps.pics` do.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> y = bartorch.fftmod(kspace * pattern, axes=(-1, -2, -3), inverse=True)
    >>> scale = optim.data_scaling(y)
    >>> x = optim.FISTA(priors.Wavelet((-1, -2), 0.01))((y / scale).squeeze(1), A)
