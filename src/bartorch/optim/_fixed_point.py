    The forward iterations run outside the graph until the moving state changes
    by at most ``tol`` of its norm, or for ``max_iter`` steps.  Differentiation
    is implicit rather than through the unrolled run: one step is taken from
    the fixed point, and the vector-Jacobian products of that step are iterated
    to their own fixed point, so memory does not grow with the iteration count.
    :attr:`iterations` is the last forward pass's count.

    A step that is not the same map at every iteration -- FISTA's momentum, a
    moving ``rho``, adaptive or decaying step sizes -- has no fixed point and
    is rejected.
