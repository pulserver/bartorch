    imaginary part, each on its own.  It is the operator for treating a
    complex array as two real channels, not the real-valued diagonal its BART
    name suggests: that is :class:`Diagonal` given a real diagonal, adjoint
    included, since conjugating a real number does nothing.

    So ``ComponentDiagonal(w)`` with a real ``w`` scales the real part by
    ``w`` and annihilates the imaginary part; scaling both takes
    ``w + 1j * w``, or :class:`Diagonal`.

    Scaling two components separately is linear over the reals and not over
    the complex numbers, as :class:`Conj` and
    :class:`~bartorch.linop.Real` are: it is self-adjoint for a real inner
    product and does not pass a complex dot test on its own.
