    Parameters
    ----------
    traj : tensor
        Trajectory ``(*encoding, shots, samples, ndim)`` in grid units,
        ``kx, ky`` or ``kx, ky, kz``, as :func:`bartorch.tools.traj` produces.
        A ``kz`` that is zero everywhere makes the transform two-dimensional.
        The encoding axes are whatever the samples vary along besides the
        shots -- frames, echoes, cardiac phases -- in any number.
    image_shape : tuple of int
        Image shape ``(*batches, *encoding, [z,] y, x)``: two spatial axes for
        a two-dimensional trajectory and three for a three-dimensional one.
        The batches -- coils, slices, anything transformed alike -- are
        whatever leads the encoding axes, and each is transformed on its own.
    kspace_shape : tuple of int, default=None
        Sample shape; by default ``(*batches, *encoding, shots, samples)``.
    weights : tensor, default=None
        Diagonal in k-space, broadcast over ``(*encoding, shots, samples)``,
        applied on the forward pass and conjugated on the adjoint.
    basis : tensor, default=None
        Temporal subspace basis ``(coeffs, frames)`` over the last encoding
        axis, which is ``coeffs`` long in the image and ``frames`` long in
        k-space.  The weights and the basis belong to the operator because its
        Toeplitz normal is built over both.
    toeplitz : bool, default=True
        Apply the normal in closed form rather than as the forward and
        adjoint applications: a convolution with a point spread function.
    oversampling : float, default=0.0
        Oversampling of FINUFFT's fine grid, BART's ``-o``.  Zero uses the
        library's setting, a quarter over by default.  On a device only 2 and
        1.25 are accepted; any other value plans on the host and fails there.
    width : float, default=0.0
        Kernel width in grid points, BART's ``-w``.  FINUFFT sizes its kernel
        from the tolerance, so the width is carried as the tolerance that gives
        it, no tighter than single precision reaches.  Zero keeps the library's
        tolerance.
