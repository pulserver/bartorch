"""The MRI encoding form, and the plan an encoding is lowered into.

Every encoding this library builds reduces to one expression, for coil ``c``,
encoding frame ``t`` and sample ``k``::

    y[c, t, k] = sum_a  O[a, t](k) . T_t( I[c, a, t](r) . x[a](r) )(k)

with ``I`` the image-side element-wise factors, ``T`` the transform, ``O`` the
k-space element-wise factors and ``sum_a`` a contraction.  :class:`Form` is that
expression in the form the library's single encoding entry point accepts, and
:class:`Plan` reports how a built operator realizes it.

Composing in Python builds a description; matching and lowering happen once,
when the operator is built, and each application is then one call into the
library.
