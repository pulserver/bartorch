    The forward model is

    with :math:`S` multiplication by the coil sensitivities,
    :math:`\mathrm{NUFFT}` the type-2 non-uniform Fourier transform along
    ``traj``, and :math:`W` the diagonal density weighting given by
    ``weights``, the identity when none is given.  The transform carries the
    weighting itself, applying it on the forward pass and its conjugate on the
    adjoint, because the Toeplitz normal is built over it.

    With a temporal basis the optimization variable holds subspace
    coefficients, which the basis maps to the acquired frames on the k-space
    side of the transform, as for :func:`~bartorch.linop.CartesianSense`.

    Coils are processed ``coil_batch`` at a time, so memory held -- including
    the doubled grid the Toeplitz normal convolves on -- scales with
    ``coil_batch`` rather than with the number of coils.

    For Cartesian sampling use :func:`~bartorch.linop.CartesianSense`, which is
    this operator over an FFT.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sensitivities : tensor
        Coil sensitivities ``([batch, sets,] coils, [z,] y, x)``, or their
        k-space kernels with ``kernels=True``.  The image carries the sets and
        the samples do not, so several sets encode as
        ``y[c] = sum_m S[m, c] x[m]``; a batch is carried by both.
    image_shape : tuple of int
        Image shape ``(*batches, [batch,] [sets,] *encoding, [z,] y, x)``: the
        batches, then the axis the sensitivities vary along and their sets,
        then the trajectory's encoding axes -- with a basis, its coefficients
        in place of the last -- then the spatial axes.
    traj : tensor, default=None
        Trajectory ``(*encoding, shots, samples, ndim)`` in grid units,
        ``kx, ky`` or ``kx, ky, kz``, as :func:`bartorch.tools.traj` produces.
        It carries no batch axis, being shared across the batch.
    kspace_shape : tuple of int, default=None
        Sample shape; by default ``(*batches, coils, *encoding, shots,
        samples)``, and on a grid ``(*batches, coils, *encoding, [z,] y, x)``.
    kernels : bool, default=False
        Read ``sensitivities`` as k-space kernels rather than maps.  The
        operator then applies the maps band-limited to the kernel;
        :func:`bartorch.maps_to_kernels` and :func:`bartorch.kernels_to_maps`
        convert between the two.
    toeplitz : bool, default=True
        Apply the normal in closed form rather than as the forward and
        adjoint applications: a convolution with a point spread function.
    modulated : bool, default=False
        On a grid, answer in BART's uncentred sample convention rather than the
        centred one.  The two differ by an ``fftmod`` on the sample axes; the
        centred convention is the default and is the one :func:`bartorch.fft`
        produces.  Rejected off a grid, where there is only one convention, and
        with ``kernels``, the modulation belonging to the whole grid.
    weights : tensor, default=None
        Diagonal in k-space, broadcast over ``(*encoding, shots, samples)``,
        applied on the forward pass and conjugated on the adjoint.
    basis : tensor, default=None
        Temporal subspace basis ``(coeffs, frames)`` over the last encoding
        axis.
    device : device, default=None
        Where the operator is built and does its arithmetic; by default where
        the trajectory is, or the sensitivities on a grid.
    coil_batch : int, default=1
        Coils applied at once; 0 applies every coil together.  A batch that
        does not divide the coils is reduced to one that does.  It changes
        residency and speed, not the result.
    fold_maps : bool, default=True
        Apply the sensitivities inside the normal's transform, saving two coil
        images per slab.  Takes effect only where the transform works one
        coefficient at a time.
    ndim : int, default=None
        Number of spatial axes, where the sensitivities and the image do not
        determine it; off a grid the trajectory does.

    Notes
    -----
    A trajectory lying on the image's own z grid -- ``z`` blocks of shots at
    ``kz = j - z // 2``, each with the same in-plane trajectory and weights --
    is applied as an FFT along z over two-dimensional transforms, given
    ``coil_batch=1`` and one set; ``plan.cartesian`` reports it.  Encoding axes
    the image also carries become items, each with its own trajectory and
    normal kernel under one coil loop, which ``plan.items`` reports.

    With the operator on a card its operands may stay on the host: the image
    crosses once each way per application, the samples and a kernel bank a slab
    at a time, and between applications the card holds the operator alone.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> A = NoncartesianSense(maps, (64, 64), traj=traj)        # maps (4, 64, 64)

class Coils(_SensitivityBatch, LinearOperator):
    """Coil sensitivities, without the transform that usually follows them.

    The multiply on its own: an image to coil images, and the conjugate
    sensitivities summed over the coils on the way back.  For an encoding
    whose transform is not a Fourier transform, and which therefore cannot be
    a SENSE operator.

    Held as maps it is the operator :class:`~bartorch.linop.MultiplySum`
    builds, and with ``coil_batch=0`` it is that operator exactly.  Held as kernels, or walked a
    slab at a time, the bank is never resident whole -- the arrangement
    :class:`NoncartesianSense` uses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sensitivities : tensor
        Coil sensitivities ``([batch, sets,] coils, [z,] y, x)``, or their
        k-space kernels with ``kernels=True``.
    image_shape : tuple of int
        Image shape ``(*batches, [batch,] [sets,] [coeffs,] [z,] y, x)``.  The
        coil images are ``(*batches, [batch,] coils, [coeffs,] [z,] y, x)``.
    kernels : bool
        Read ``sensitivities`` as k-space kernels rather than maps, as
        :class:`NoncartesianSense` does.
    device : device, optional
        Where the operator is built and does its arithmetic; by default where
        the sensitivities are.
    coil_batch : int
        Coils applied at once; 0 applies every coil together.  The
        sensitivities are the same either way.
    coeffs : int
        Subspace coefficients the image carries, on an axis of their own in
        front of the spatial ones.  The sensitivities are shared across them,
        so the multiply is unchanged.
    ndim : int, optional
        Number of spatial axes, where the sensitivities and the image do not
        determine it.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> S = Coils(kernels, (y, x), kernels=True, ndim=2)
    >>> A = FFT(S.oshape, axes=(-2, -1)) @ S
