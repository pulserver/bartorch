    BART's ``linop_grad``.  The codomain is ``(len(axes), *shape)``: one
    difference per axis, side by side, which is the operator a total-variation term is
    built on.

    The difference is the forward one and the boundary is circular: component
    ``i`` at the last index along its axis is the first entry minus the last,
    not zero.  So the operator has a null space -- a constant maps to zero --
    as a gradient does.

    **The components come out in ascending axis order**, whatever order
    ``axes`` names them in.  BART stacks them by bit position, and its bits
    run the opposite way to C-order axes, so this reverses that with BART's
    own ``linop_flip`` rather than leaving the caller to discover that
    ``axes=(0, 1)`` puts axis 1 first.

    axes : int or tuple of int
