"""Making torch's and FINUFFT's OpenMP runtimes one runtime, on macOS.

Both wheels carry their own copy of LLVM's OpenMP runtime -- torch at
``torch/lib/libomp.dylib`` and FINUFFT at ``finufft/.dylibs/libomp.dylib`` --
and the runtime ends the process rather than run beside a second copy of
itself (``OMP: Error #15``).  Pointing FINUFFT's library at the copy torch
carries leaves one runtime loaded, so the substitution can be taken up with
OpenMP left on in both.

That is not what ``KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`` does: the flag tells one
runtime to tolerate a second live copy, with two thread pools and two sets of
thread-local state behind it, which the runtime's own authors document as
unsafe.  Here there is one copy, and the two share its pool.

:func:`ensure` is the attempt the substitution makes for itself, before it
loads FINUFFT's library; ``scripts/macos_openmp.py`` is the same thing by
hand.  It rewrites a file inside another package, so ``pip install -U
finufft`` undoes it and it runs again; a library already pointed at torch's
copy is left alone.
