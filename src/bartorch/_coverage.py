"""Where each BART command is exposed, or why it is not.

Every command BART builds is exactly one of: wrapped by hand (marked with
:func:`bartorch._call.curated`), derived from the catalogue into a
:mod:`bartorch.tools` section, or private.  ``tests/test_tools.py`` checks the
partition, so a command added by a BART update must be placed before the
suite passes.  A private command still runs through
:func:`bartorch._dispatch.dispatch`.
