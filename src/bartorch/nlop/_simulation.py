"""Signal models from BlochSim, as BART nonlinear operators.

:class:`SignalModel` bridges BlochSim's
:class:`~blochsim.recon.ModelOperator` -- a model's value, its
Jacobian-vector product and its adjoint product, none of which builds a
Jacobian -- onto the three things BART's ``nlop_s`` asks for.
:func:`InversionRecovery`, :func:`MultiEcho` and :func:`Bloch` are the
quantitative models built on BlochSim's simulators, in BlochSim's
parameterisation.  The suite holds their curves and their fits against BART's
own signal models.

Notes
-----
BlochSim's parameter maps are real and stacked on the **last** axis.  BART
works in ``complex float`` on a C-order shape with the channels in front, so
the bridge moves the axis and carries the maps in the real part of a complex
buffer.  The imaginary half is an exact null direction of the derivative --
nothing reads it and the adjoint returns zero there -- so an iterate that
starts real stays real to the bit.

    """A BlochSim signal model as a BART nonlinear operator.

    The operator maps parameter maps to one image per contrast.  What it does
    at each point is BlochSim's: :meth:`~blochsim.recon.ModelOperator.A` for
    the value, ``A_jvp`` for the derivative and ``A_vjp`` for its adjoint, none
    of which builds a Jacobian -- the model is voxel-diagonal, so one
    forward-mode pass gives the whole volume's derivative whatever the
    parameter count.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : blochsim.recon.ModelOperator
        The signal model, with its unknowns, bounds and scales already set.
    shape : tuple of int, default=()
        The voxel shape, C order -- ``(y, x)``, ``(z, y, x)``, whatever the
        maps are.  The operator's domain is ``(channels, *shape)`` and its
        codomain ``(contrasts, *shape)``.
    contrasts : int, default=None
        How many images the model returns.  Measured from the model when it
        is not given.

    Attributes
    ----------
    channels : int
        Map channels the domain carries, in BlochSim's order.

    --------

    bounds : dict, default=None
        ``{name: (low, high)}``, either end ``None`` for unbounded.  A bound
        is kept by solving for a transformed variable, so no iterate leaves
