    with the inverse computed by conjugate gradients inside the library and

    holds its items, as ``CoilSense(..., items=True)`` does, is stepped as one,
    with each item's inner problem solved on its own.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=1.0
        Initial Tikhonov weight.
    alpha_min : float, default=0.0
        What the weight decays towards.
    alpha_min0 : float, default=0.0
        Floor the decayed weight is never taken below; second form only.
    redu : float, default=2.0
        Factor the weight is divided by after each step.
    cg_maxiter : int, default=30
        The first form's conjugate-gradient iterations, ``iter_conjgrad_conf``'s
        ``maxiter``.
    cg_tol : float, default=0.0
        Its tolerance, ``iter_conjgrad_conf``'s ``tol``.  A nonzero ``tol`` is
        refused by BART once the step is differentiated.
    cg_lambda : float, default=0.0
        Its Tikhonov weight, ``iter_conjgrad_conf``'s ``l2lambda``.
    inner : solver, default=None
        A configured solver from :mod:`bartorch.optim` for the linearized
        problem; its regularizers are ``R``.
    fuse : bool, default=True
        Lower a coil composition so that its encoding is applied once as its
        normal operator; see :meth:`plan`.

    Notes
    -----
    ``alpha`` and ``redu`` are :class:`torch.nn.Parameter` objects, frozen until
    ``requires_grad_()``.  The first form is differentiable by the data, the
    iterate, the centre and ``alpha``.  The second form is differentiable by
    the data, the iterate, the centre and the inner solver's own settings and
    priors; it gives ``alpha`` to the solver as a number, so ``alpha`` is held
    fixed there.

        What the weight decays towards.
    alpha_min0 : float, default=0.0
        A floor the decayed weight is never taken below.  Only the second
        form has it; BART's ``irgnm`` does not.
    redu : float, default=2.0

    cg_maxiter : int, default=30
        Conjugate-gradient iterations per step, for the built-in solver.
    cg_tol : float, default=0.0
        Conjugate-gradient tolerance per step, for the built-in solver.
    inner : solver or None, default=None
        A configured solver from :mod:`bartorch.optim` for the linearized
        problem, whose regularizers become the ``R`` above.  ``None`` runs
        BART's first form, with the inverse inside the library, as ``nlinv``
        does.
    fuse : bool, default=True
        Lower a coil composition so that its encoding is applied once as its
        normal operator.

    Examples
    --------
    Plain, which is ``nlinv``:

    >>> nlop.IRGNM(iterations=8)(kspace, F, x0=start)

    The same method with the linearized problem written out here, which is
    ``iter4_irgnm2`` to the bit:

    >>> nlop.IRGNM(iterations=8, inner=optim.CG())(kspace, F, x0=start)

    Wavelet-regularized:

    >>> nlop.IRGNM(inner=optim.FISTA(priors.Wavelet((-1, -2), 0.001), maxiter=30))(
    ...     kspace, F, x0=start
    ... )

    Several terms at once, which is ADMM's job:

    >>> nlop.IRGNM(
    ...     inner=optim.ADMM(
    ...         [priors.Wavelet((-1, -2), 0.001), priors.TotalVariation((-1, -2), 0.01)]
    ...     )
    ... )(kspace, F, x0=start)

    Notes
    -----
    The two forms are the same method and not the same arithmetic.  The first
    carries ``alpha (xref - x)`` into the right-hand side and solves for a
    step; the second shifts by ``xref``, carries an extra ``DF (x - xref)``
    into the residual, and solves for the iterate itself.  They agree in exact
    arithmetic and differ in the last bits, so a run with ``inner=`` will not
    reproduce one without it.  Each reproduces BART's own loop of its form --
    ``iter4_irgnm`` and, with ``inner=optim.CG()``, ``iter4_irgnm2`` -- and the
    suite holds both to that.

    """Solve ``F(x) = y`` by iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton.

    Linearizes ``F`` at the current iterate and solves the linearized problem
    under a Tikhonov weight that decays from ``alpha`` towards ``alpha_min``,
    so early steps are strongly regularized and later ones are not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : tensor
        Data of ``F.oshapes[0]``.
    F : NonlinearOperator
        The forward model.
    x0 : tensor or tuple of tensor, default=None
        Starting iterate; without one the model's own initial value is used.
    xref : tensor or tuple of tensor, default=None
        Regularization centre the steps are pulled towards; without one they
        are regularized towards zero.
    inner : solver, default=None
        Solver for the linearized problem, from :mod:`bartorch.optim`.  Without
        one it is solved by conjugate gradients inside the library.
    **settings
        Settings of :class:`IRGNM`, among them ``iterations`` (8), ``alpha``,
        ``alpha_min`` and ``redu``.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor or tuple of torch.Tensor
        The solution, one tensor per input of ``F``.
