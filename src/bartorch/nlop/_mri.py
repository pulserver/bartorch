class NonlinearSense(NonlinearOperator):
    r"""Joint image and coil-sensitivity forward model, BART's ``noir``.

    The operator has **two** inputs, the image and the coil representation, and
    one output, the data.  Its derivative with respect to either input is a
    linear operator (:meth:`~bartorch.nlop.NonlinearOperator.linearize`), and a
    Gauss-Newton step solves the linearized problem over both jointly.

    The coil unknown is not the sensitivity maps.  It is a k-space
    representation :math:`\hat{s}` of them, from which the maps follow by the
    Sobolev weighting

    .. math::

        S = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left[ \, \kappa \,
            (1 + a |k|^2)^{-b/2} \, \hat{s} \, \right]

    with ``sobolev`` giving :math:`(a, b)` and ``c`` the scale
    :math:`\kappa` (BART's ``noir_calc_weights``).  The weighting is part of
    the model, so the estimated variable is smoothness-regularized by
    construction and the Gauss-Newton step needs no separate penalty on the
    coils.  :attr:`coils` is the linear operator mapping fitted coefficients to
    sensitivities.

    Off the grid the model is asymmetric, as BART builds it: it returns gridded
    coil images rather than samples, so a measurement must be gridded to match.
    :meth:`prepare` does that, and is a no-op on a grid, where the model
    returns k-space directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : tuple of int
        Coil-image shape, ``(coils, *spatial)``, C order -- the same shape the
        linear encodings take.  The image itself is this with one coil.
    pattern : tensor, default=None
        Binary sampling mask, one at acquired positions and zero elsewhere,
        on a grid.  Without one the acquisition is treated as fully sampled.
    trajectory : tensor, default=None
        Trajectory ``(..., samples, 3)`` in grid units, ``kx, ky, kz``, as
        :func:`bartorch.tools.traj` produces.  Giving one selects the
        non-Cartesian model.
    kspace_shape : tuple of int, default=None
        Sample shape.  Off the grid it defaults to the trajectory's with the
        image's coil axes in front, as the NUFFT's does; on the grid it is the
        coil-image shape.
    coil_shape, coefficient_shape : tuple of int, default=None
        Where the sensitivities live and where their coefficients do; both
        default to the coil-image shape.
    weights : tensor, default=None
        Diagonal in k-space applied to the samples, off the grid; its
        conjugate is applied on the adjoint.
    basis : tensor, default=None
        Temporal subspace basis ``(coeffs, frames)`` over the last encoding
        axis, off the grid.  The Cartesian model does not take one.
    mask : tensor, default=None
        A support the image is restricted to.
    sobolev : tuple of float, default=(220.0, 32.0)
        ``(a, b)`` of the coil weighting ``c (1 + a |k|^2)^(-b/2)``; BART's
        ``220, 32``.
    c : float, default=1.0
        The scale on that weighting, BART's ``1``.
    real : bool, default=False
        Constrain the image to be real.
    sos : bool, default=False
        BART's sum-of-squares variant of the coil weighting.
    oversampling_coils : float, default=None
        Fit the coils on a finer grid than the image.  By default whichever
        ``nlinv`` uses: two off the grid, one on it.
    oversampled_coils : bool, default=False
        Return them on that grid rather than on the image's.
    toeplitz : bool, default=True
        Apply the normal in closed form rather than as the forward and
        adjoint applications: a convolution with a point spread function, off
        the grid.
    optimized : bool, default=False
        BART's ``noir2_noncart_optimized_create``, off the grid.
