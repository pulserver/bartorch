"""Nonlinear operators defined by Python functions.

One argument or many.  A function of several tensors becomes an ``nlop`` of
several inputs, which lets a denoiser's weights be an *argument* of a
BART graph rather than something the function closed over -- and so what lets
a gradient reach them when the graph is BART's to apply.

    ``forward`` evaluates the operator and fixes the point at which

    which is how BART's solvers use them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    oshape, ishape : tuple of int, or a sequence of them
        Codomain and domain shapes, C order.  A sequence of shapes makes an
        operator of that many outputs or inputs.
    forward : callable
        ``forward(x)`` for one input, ``forward(*xs)`` for several; it returns
        one tensor per output.  It fixes the linearisation point.
    derivative, adjoint : callable
        With one argument each way, ``derivative(dx)`` and ``adjoint(dy)``.
        With several, ``derivative(o, i, dx)`` and ``adjoint(o, i, dy)``: the
        derivative of output ``o`` by input ``i``, and the adjoint of it.

    --------
    >>> NonlinearOperator.from_callbacks(

    Two inputs, so that the second can carry a weight a gradient reaches:

    ----------
    fn : callable

    -----
    A real argument is carried in the real part of a complex one: BART's
