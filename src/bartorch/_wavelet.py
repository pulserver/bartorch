    """Forward multi-level discrete wavelet transform along ``axes``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : torch.Tensor
        Every transformed axis needs at least 16 samples, the coarsest scale.
    axes : int or tuple of int
        Axes to transform, as indices into ``input.shape``.
    wavelet : {"haar", "dau2", "cdf44", "cdf97"}, default='dau2'
        ``"haar"``, ``"dau2"`` and ``"cdf44"`` are, along one axis,
        PyWavelets' ``wavedec`` with ``"haar"``, ``"db2"`` and ``"bior4.4"``
        in ``mode="symmetric"``, concatenated coarse first.  Each level keeps
        ``(n + taps - 1) // 2`` coefficients per band, so there are more
        coefficients than samples unless the filter has two taps and every
        level's length is even; levels continue while that half-length is at
        least 16.  ``"cdf97"`` is CDF 9/7 by lifting, in place, coarse band
        first, levels continuing while every transformed axis is longer than
        32; one level of an even length is PyWavelets' ``"bior4.4"`` in
        ``mode="periodization"`` with the detail band negated.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        For ``"cdf97"``, the shape of ``input``.  Otherwise the coefficients
        of all transformed axes are flattened into the last of ``axes``, and
        the other transformed axes have size one.

    ``bart wavelet -a`` runs the synthesis filter bank, which inverts
    :func:`fwt` (``iwt(fwt(x)) == x``) for every wavelet.  It is a left
    inverse, not the adjoint, although BART's wavelet linop uses it as its
    adjoint: synthesis ignores the reflected samples the analysis read
    (``wavelet_up3``, ``src/wavelet/wavelet.c``).  The two coincide only for
    ``"haar"`` when every level's length is even, where the transform is
    orthogonal.  ``"cdf97"`` runs ``bart cdf97 -i``, the exact inverse of a
    biorthogonal transform that is not orthogonal.
