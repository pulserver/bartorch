    """Regularization functional with a proximal operator built by BART.

    A regularizer represents :math:`g(G x)`: a linear transform :math:`G` and
    the proximal operator of a functional :math:`g` acting on its codomain.
    :math:`G` is the identity for terms that penalize the image directly, and
    for terms carrying their own transform inside the proximal operator, such
    as :class:`~bartorch.priors.Wavelet`; it is a genuine operator for terms
    such as :class:`~bartorch.priors.TotalVariation`, whose functional acts on
    finite differences.  Both come from BART's ``opt_reg_configure``.

    Only the alternating-direction and primal-dual iterations are given
    :math:`G`; see :meth:`transform_is_identity`.

    Both are built per image shape and cached, and handed to a solver as they
    are, so solving twice with the same term builds nothing the second time.

    ----------

    axes : tuple of int

    joint_axes : tuple of int
        Axes along which the term acts jointly.
    count : int
        Entries an NIHT term keeps; zero for every other term.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> term = priors.Wavelet((-1, -2), 0.01)

        This is the proximal operator alone.  A term may also carry a linear
        transform in front of it -- see :meth:`transform` -- in which case a
        solver computes ``prox(transform(x))``.  BART's ``iter2_ist`` applies
        the proximal operator to the image and ignores the transform entirely,
        so IST and FISTA admit only terms whose transform is the identity; a
        total-variation term is excluded, its proximal operator not being
        shaped like an image.
