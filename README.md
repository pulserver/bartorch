bartorch embeds BART, the Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox, in the
Python process and calls it on PyTorch tensors in host or CUDA device memory.
BART's commands are Python functions; its linear and nonlinear operators are
composable Python objects; its iterative algorithms are solver classes and
iteration blocks.  Applying an operator or a solver to a tensor that
requires a gradient records it for PyTorch autograd.  The arithmetic is BART's
except where bartorch substitutes a component: FINUFFT and cuFINUFFT compute
every non-uniform Fourier transform, the FFT and BLAS/LAPACK routines come from
MKL, PyTorch's linked library or SciPy, and the MRI encoding operators run on
bartorch's own executor built from BART's operators.

## Features

- BART commands (`pics`, `ecalib`, `nlinv`, `moba`, ...) as functions of
  tensors, and the `bartorch` command line, which accepts the arguments of `bart`.
- MRI encoding operators — Cartesian, non-Cartesian and wave-encoded SENSE,
  off-resonance correction — composed with `@` and `+` into single BART operators.
- BART's regularization terms and its CG, IST, FISTA, ADMM and primal-dual
  iterations, as solvers and as differentiable iteration blocks.
- Nonlinear operators, iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton, and quantitative
  signal models from TorchSim.
- Adapters for unrolled networks, plug-and-play denoisers and DeepInverse.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install bartorch
```

```python
import bartorch.tools as bt
from bartorch import priors

kspace = bt.phantom(128, coils=8, kspace=True)  # (coils, z, y, x)
maps = bt.ecalib(kspace, maps=1)
image = bt.pics(kspace, maps, regularizers=priors.Wavelet((-1, -2), 0.005), solver="fista")
```

The same reconstruction can be assembled from an encoding operator and a
solver; [Interfaces and execution](https://pulserver.github.io/bartorch/latest/explanation/execution-model.html)
describes which interface fits which task.

## Citation

bartorch has no publication or archival DOI.  Work that uses it should cite
BART and the methods it applied (ESPIRiT, compressed sensing, nonlinear
inversion, ...), and report the bartorch version or commit and the pinned
BART revision; [Contributors and citation](https://pulserver.github.io/bartorch/latest/misc/contributors.html)
gives the references and what else a reproducible report records.
