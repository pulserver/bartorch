# License and third-party notices

bartorch is distributed under the MIT license below.  The components it
embeds or vendors keep their own licenses, which the MIT license does not
replace; their notices are distributed with the source and in each wheel's
`.dist-info/licenses/` directory.

## Dependencies

The following are installed as separate packages, each under its own license,
and are not redistributed by bartorch: PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, FINUFFT and
cuFINUFFT (Apache-2.0), TorchSim, MRI-NUFFT, and the optional MKL and
DeepInverse.  The CUDA wheel links the CUDA runtime, cuFFT and cuBLAS
dynamically and does not contain them.

## Logo

The bartorch logo and mark combine three elements, which
`scripts/make_artwork.py` draws:

| Element | Source | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The BART mark: the letters and the corner brackets | The outline in BART's `src/geom/logo.c` | BSD-3-Clause, BART's license above |
| The flame | The PyTorch logo, `assets/images/logo-icon.svg` of [pytorch/pytorch.github.io](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.github.io), reproduced unaltered in shape and colour and only scaled | A trademark of The Linux Foundation |
| The letters `rch` | Glyph outlines of DejaVu Sans Bold | Bitstream Vera license; DejaVu's changes are in the public domain |
