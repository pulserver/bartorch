===========================
Radial SENSE reconstruction
===========================

An undersampled golden-angle radial acquisition reconstructed by regularized
least squares, with the non-Cartesian SENSE operator

.. math::

   A = W \\, \\mathrm{NUFFT} \\, S.

The sensitivities are estimated from the radial data itself, and the same
reconstruction is run twice: once through :func:`bartorch.tools.pics` and once
through the operator and a solver, the route an encoding BART has no
application for would take.

The measured data are simulated with the same transform the reconstruction
uses — an inverse crime — so the experiment measures the effect of
undersampling, noise and the estimated sensitivities, not that of a mismatch
between the forward model and the measurement.

The phantom and the coil sensitivities are built as in
:doc:`../01-basics/01-from-kspace-to-image`; the cell that does it is hidden on
this page and present in the script this page can be downloaded as.

# -----------

# Sixty-four golden-angle spokes across a 192 matrix, which is a fifth of the

# of every channel along the trajectory; the reconstruction uses the same
# operator over the estimated sensitivities.

#
# The operator's samples are ``(coils, shots, samples)``. BART's applications
# carry the k-space in its own layout, ``(coils, shots, samples, 1)``, whose
# trailing axis is the readout dimension a Cartesian acquisition would use, so
# an application is given ``measured[..., None]``.
#
# Sensitivity calibration
# -----------------------
#
# ESPIRiT reads its calibration matrix from a Cartesian neighbourhood, so on
# non-Cartesian data it needs the centre of k-space gridded first.
# :func:`bartorch.tools.ncalib` instead estimates the sensitivities from the
# samples as they were measured, by nonlinear inversion [#nlinv]_ at low
# resolution.
#
# ``N=True`` divides the estimated maps by their own root sum of squares. What
# a SENSE fit recovers is the image :math:`x` for which :math:`Sx` explains the
# data, so maps whose root sum of squares varies across the field of view leave
# its reciprocal in the image as a smooth shading. ESPIRiT normalizes its maps
# by construction; a nonlinear inversion does not, and ``N=True`` requests the
# normalization.

# %%
#
# Gridding
# --------
#
# The reference reconstruction is the density-compensated adjoint: weight each
# sample by its distance from the centre of k-space, map the samples onto the
# grid, and combine the channels by the root sum of squares. It uses no model
# of the encoding, so the undersampling appears in it as the streaks the point
# spread function of a radial trajectory predicts.

# Reconstruction
# --------------

# Total variation [#rof]_ penalizes the streaks, which are not piecewise
# constant, more than the anatomy, which largely is. The operator is the
# non-Cartesian SENSE model [#pruessmann2001]_, and ADMM is the algorithm
# ``pics`` selects for the penalty.

# The same solve through the operator. Besides the iteration, the application
# scales the data; off a grid the scaling is estimated from the adjoint
# reconstruction and therefore needs the operator, which
# :func:`bartorch.optim.data_scaling` takes. The encoding is the operator
# built above, now over the estimated sensitivities rather than the true ones.

# %%
#
# The normal operator
# -------------------
#
# Each iteration applies :math:`A^H A`, which the operator computes by default
# as a convolution with a point spread function rather than as a transform each
# way. ``toeplitz=False`` asks for the transform pair instead. The two normal
# operators differ by the tolerance the transform is planned to, and fifty
