=====================
Operators and solvers
=====================

The same reconstruction written as an encoding operator and a solver rather
than as a call to a BART application.

:func:`bartorch.tools.pics` builds three objects and runs BART's iteration
with them: the encoding operator, the regularization terms, and the algorithm.
:mod:`bartorch.linop` and :mod:`bartorch.optim` expose those three separately,
for the reconstructions BART has no application for: an encoding with an extra
factor in it, a solver reached from an outer loop, an operator defined in
Python.

This example builds the encoding of :doc:`01-from-kspace-to-image`, checks it
against the definition of an adjoint, solves with it, and compares the result
with the application. The phantom, the coil sensitivities and the sampling are
that example's; the cell that builds them is hidden on this page and present in
the script this page can be downloaded as.

#
# The encoding operator
# ---------------------
#
# :func:`bartorch.linop.CartesianSense` is :math:`A = P F S` as one operator.
# It takes the sensitivities, the shape of the image it maps from, and the
# sampling pattern; the shape of the k-space it maps to follows from those.
# :func:`bartorch.tools.pattern` reads the pattern off the measured data, as
# for a prospectively undersampled acquisition.
#
# ``modulated=True`` selects BART's uncentred sample convention, which its
# applications iterate in; the default is the centred convention that
# :func:`bartorch.fft` produces. The two differ by a modulation of the samples
# and give the same image, so the choice matters only when the operator is
# applied to data already in one of them, as it is below.

# %%
#
# ``A.plan`` reports the form the operator was lowered into: which transform,
# what multiplies the image and the samples, and how the normal operator
# :math:`A^H A` is applied. It is a property of the built operator rather than
# a prediction, and ``plan.fused`` is false where the composition could not be
# expressed as one encoding and fell back to a chain, which computes the same
# numbers more slowly.
#
# Applying the adjoint is not the same as applying the transpose, and a
# reconstruction built on the wrong one converges to the wrong image. The
# definition :math:`\langle Ax, y\rangle = \langle x, A^H y\rangle` holds for
# any pair of vectors, and holds for random vectors as readily as for real
# data, so it is a usable check on an operator.

# Solving
# -------
#
# A solver is called as ``solver(y, A)``. What it is given is not the array
# the scanner wrote but what ``pics`` iterates on: the sampling pattern
# applied, the modulation into the uncentred convention, and the data divided
# by the scaling :func:`bartorch.optim.data_scaling` estimates from the adjoint
# reconstruction, which is the step that makes a regularization weight
# transferable from one dataset to the next.

#
# Operator algebra
# ----------------
#
# ``@`` composes, ``+`` adds, ``A.H`` is the adjoint and ``A.gram()`` the
# normal operator :math:`A^H A`. A composition builds a single BART operator
# rather than a Python chain, so a solver iterating on it does not return to
# Python between applications. :func:`bartorch.optim.maxeigen` runs the power
# iteration on an operator, which is how a gradient step size is chosen: the
# Lipschitz constant of the least-squares gradient is the largest eigenvalue of
# :math:`A^H A`.

# ---------------

# Applying an operator to a tensor that requires a gradient records the
# application for autograd. The gradient torch propagates back through
# :math:`y = Ax` is :math:`A^H g` rather than :math:`A^T g`, the conjugate
# Wirtinger convention torch uses for complex tensors.  For a real :math:`A`,
