=====================================
Parameter maps straight from k-space
=====================================

A multi-echo spin-echo acquisition fitted for :math:`T_2` in two ways: by
reconstructing the echo images and fitting them afterwards, and by putting the
signal model inside the forward operator and fitting the k-space directly.

The two-step route solves an ill-posed reconstruction eight times over, once
per echo, and then fits a model to the answers. Each reconstruction is
undersampled on its own, and none of the eight uses the relation between the
echo images. The model-based route puts that relation in the forward operator,

.. math::

   y_{c,e} = P_e F \\, (S_c \\cdot M_e(\\theta)),

where :math:`M` is the signal model and :math:`\\theta` the parameter maps, and
solves for :math:`\\theta` directly [#sumpf]_ [#wang]_. The unknowns then number
three maps rather than eight images, and every echo constrains all of them.

The model here is :class:`bartorch.nlop.MultiEcho`, a TorchSim simulator as a
BART nonlinear operator; the solver is the Gauss-Newton loop of
:doc:`01-nonlinear-inversion`, over a different model.

The phantom and the coil sensitivities are built as in
:doc:`../01-basics/01-from-kspace-to-image`; the cell that does it is hidden on
this page and present in the script this page can be downloaded as.

# The echo images carry the residual aliasing of each echo's sampling, and the
# voxel-wise fit that follows cannot separate it from signal decay, so it
# propagates into the two-step :math:`T_2` map. Fitting the k-space constrains
# the three maps with all eight echoes at once; the model, the solver and the
# number of steps are the same in both routes, and the printed errors compare
# the two maps with the phantom. The explanation of the model-based approach is
# :doc:`../../explanation/nonlinear`.
# The maps are drawn with the navia colormap [#fuderer]_.
#
# What this route also makes available is regularization of the maps rather
# than of the images, since the maps are the solver's unknowns; BART's own
# ``moba`` is :func:`bartorch.tools.moba`, and applies its penalties there.
