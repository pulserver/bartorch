====================
MoDL, on BART's ADMM
====================

An unrolled network for undersampled Cartesian SENSE: a convolutional denoiser
in the proximal step of BART's alternating-direction iteration, trained end to
end against fully sampled images.

MoDL [#modl]_ writes a reconstruction as an alternation between a learned denoiser and a
data-consistency step, and trains the denoiser through it. As published the
alternation is half-quadratic splitting, which is

.. math::

   z^{k} &= D_w(x^{k}) \\
   x^{k+1} &= \arg\min_x \; \|A x - y\|_2^2 + \lambda \|x - z^{k}\|_2^2,

the second line a conjugate-gradient solve of :math:`(A^H A + \lambda) x = A^H
y + \lambda z^{k}`. The alternating direction method of multipliers
[#boyd]_ is the same splitting with a dual variable :math:`u` carried along:

.. math::

   x^{k+1} &= \arg\min_x \; \|A x - y\|_2^2 + \rho \|x - z^{k} + u^{k}\|_2^2 \\
   z^{k+1} &= D_w(x^{k+1} + u^{k}) \\
   u^{k+1} &= u^{k} + x^{k+1} - z^{k+1},

MoDL is therefore this iteration with :math:`u` fixed at zero. The dual
variable accumulates the mismatch between the data-consistent and the denoised
iterate, so that a fixed point of the iteration solves the constrained problem
rather than the penalized one.

The iteration itself is BART's. :class:`bartorch.optim.ADMMBlock` implements
``admm.c``'s step, including the conjugate-gradient x-update that MoDL's own
implementation writes out, and :class:`bartorch.learning.Unrolled` applies it
repeatedly. The network supplies the proximal step, through
:class:`bartorch.priors.ImplicitPrior`; the penalty parameter :math:`\rho` is a
parameter of the block and is trained with the network's weights.

# Differentiating a deeper stack
# ------------------------------
#
# Five iterations of a two-dimensional encoding record a graph of modest size.
# Ten iterations of a three-dimensional non-Cartesian encoding do not, and the
# memory is dominated by the denoiser's activations: the backward pass of an
# operator is a further application of that operator and stores nothing growing
# with the iteration count, whereas a convolutional network stores every
# activation, once per iteration.
#
# :class:`~bartorch.learning.Unrolled` provides two alternatives, neither of
# which changes the forward value
# (:doc:`../../explanation/differentiation`):
#
# * ``detach=True`` starts each iteration from a detached state, so that the
#   graph spans one iteration. With a loss on each image yielded by
#   :meth:`~bartorch.learning.Unrolled.steps`, this is greedy per-iteration
#   training, whose memory is independent of the iteration count.
# * ``checkpoint=True`` retains the states between iterations and recomputes
#   the interior of a step during the backward pass. The gradient is the
#   end-to-end one and each block is applied twice.
#
# Pretraining the denoiser in isolation, then greedy per-iteration training,
# then end-to-end fine-tuning with checkpointing, is the staged schedule
