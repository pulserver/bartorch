# Interfaces and execution

```{admonition} TL;DR
:class: tldr

- bartorch has two interfaces to one embedded BART: BART's commands as functions of tensors ({mod}`bartorch.tools`, the `bartorch` command line), and the objects the commands are built from — operators, regularization terms and solvers ({mod}`bartorch.linop`, {mod}`bartorch.nlop`, {mod}`bartorch.priors`, {mod}`bartorch.optim`).
- A command runs a standard reconstruction in one call and returns BART's result; the composable objects are needed for an encoding BART has no application for, a solver inside an outer loop, or gradients.
- {mod}`bartorch.apps` re-expresses applications with the composable objects: identical results on a Cartesian grid, agreement to floating-point round-off along a trajectory.
- Operators pass tensors to BART without copying and commands copy their inputs by default; an error inside BART raises {class}`~bartorch.BartError`, and FINUFFT or cuFINUFFT computes every non-uniform Fourier transform.
```

bartorch exposes BART at two levels.  The command-style interface calls BART's
applications — `pics`, `ecalib`, `nlinv` — as functions of tensors.  The
composable interface exposes the objects those applications are built from:
the encoding operator, the regularization terms and the iterative algorithm,
which a reconstruction assembles in Python.  Both call the same embedded BART
through one C interface.

## The interfaces

| Interface | Unit | Autograd | Runs as |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {mod}`bartorch.tools` | One BART command | No | The command, in this process |
| `bartorch.fft`, `fwt`, `rss`, ... ({doc}`../api/functions`) | One array operation | No | A BART command |
| `bartorch` command line ({mod}`bartorch.cli`) | A `bart` command line on CFL files | No | An app where one exists, otherwise the command |
| {mod}`bartorch.linop`, {mod}`bartorch.nlop` | An operator and its adjoint or derivative | Yes | A BART operator, or Python callbacks |
| {mod}`bartorch.optim`, {mod}`bartorch.priors` | A solver or one iteration step, and its terms | Yes, per solver | BART's iteration: CG in the library, proximal steps in Python over BART's operators |
| {mod}`bartorch.apps` | A BART application re-expressed with operators and solvers | As its solver | The composable interface |
| {mod}`bartorch.learning`, {mod}`bartorch.interop` | Adapters to networks and to DeepInverse | Yes | PyTorch around the composable interface |

A command runs a standard reconstruction in one call, and its result is
BART's by construction.  The composable interface is needed when the
encoding has no BART application — an additional factor in the forward model,
a subspace with an off-resonance correction, an operator defined in Python — when a
solver is called from an outer loop such as Gauss-Newton, or when gradients
are required.

## Commands and apps

{func}`bartorch.apps.pics` performs the steps of BART's `pics` with this
package's objects: the sampling pattern, the modulation into BART's uncentred
convention and the data scaling in Python, then an encoding from
{mod}`bartorch.linop` under a solver from {mod}`bartorch.optim`.  On a
Cartesian grid it returns the tensor the command returns; along a trajectory
the two agree to floating-point round-off, because FINUFFT accumulates over
threads in an order that varies between runs.  The command itself is not
public; the test suite holds the app to it.  An app is the
starting point for a variant of an application: its steps are Python that can
be read and changed.  {func}`bartorch.apps.mobafit` does not reproduce its command: it fits a
TorchSim signal model rather than BART's, and returns named maps in physical
units.

The `bartorch` command line reads a `bart` command line.  Where an app exists
for the command and expresses every option given, the app runs; otherwise the
command itself runs.  {func}`bartorch.cli.route` reports which.

## Implementation layers

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Python and ctypes | A tensor crosses as its data pointer and its shape reversed into a BART dimension vector; a C-order tensor and a BART array of the reversed dimensions are the same memory, so operators copy nothing.  Commands work on copies of their inputs by default, because some BART commands write into their inputs. |
| bartorch C ABI (`libbartorch`) | Runs commands and operators under BART's error handler, so an error or a failed assertion inside BART raises {class}`~bartorch.BartError` instead of ending the process.  Arrays BART allocates are allocated by PyTorch on the device of the call. |
| Embedded BART | The commands, the linear and nonlinear operators and the iterative algorithms, compiled from the pinned revision of the downstream fork `pulserver/bart`, which follows the Codeberg upstream with a small patch stack. |
| Encoding executor | bartorch's implementation of the MRI encoding operators: SENSE over an FFT, a NUFFT or a wave transform, applied to a slab of coils at a time and built from BART's operators; described in {doc}`encoding`. |
| Substitutions and backends | Components compiled in place of BART's, and the libraries they call: FINUFFT and cuFINUFFT for every non-uniform Fourier transform and point spread function ({doc}`non-cartesian`); MKL's DFTI or the compiled pocketfft for the FFT; BLAS and LAPACK routines from MKL, from PyTorch's linked library, or from SciPy. |

On a CUDA device, operators and solvers work on device memory directly; BART
uses cuFFT and cuBLAS, cuFINUFFT computes non-uniform transforms, and BART's
work is ordered against PyTorch's current stream.  Some commands allocate host
temporaries internally, and are given host copies of their inputs; their
results are returned on the device.

## Numerical correspondence with BART

Outside the substitutions, bartorch runs BART's code.  A substitution changes
a result only within the accuracy of the substituted computation: for the
non-uniform FFT that is the tolerance it is planned with, $10^{-3}$ by default.
The iterations of {mod}`bartorch.optim` reproduce BART's step sizes, penalty
updates and stopping rules; for the Cartesian configurations the test suite
covers, the assembled solvers return the same tensors as `pics`, bit for bit.
{func}`bartorch.apps.mobafit` fits a TorchSim signal model and does not
reproduce its command.  Where a configuration cannot be
served — a non-Cartesian transform FINUFFT cannot compute, a term an iteration
cannot apply — the call raises an error with the reason rather than computing
the result by another method.
