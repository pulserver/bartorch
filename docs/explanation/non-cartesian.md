# Non-Cartesian sampling

```{admonition} TL;DR
:class: tldr

- The forward transform is a type-2 non-uniform FFT with a negative exponent and a $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling, along trajectories in grid units; the adjoint is the type-1 transform.
- FINUFFT on the CPU and cuFINUFFT on a CUDA device compute it to a relative tolerance, $10^{-3}$ by default, on a grid oversampled by 1.25.
- The adjoint is not an inverse: density compensation approximates one, and a regularized reconstruction needs none.
- The transform's normal operator is a convolution with a point spread function, applied by FFTs on a doubled grid unless `toeplitz=False`.
- No configuration falls back to BART's own gridding; an unsupported one raises {class}`~bartorch.BartError` with the reason.

A radial, spiral or other non-Cartesian acquisition samples k-space at
positions that are not on a grid, so its Fourier transform is not an FFT.  This
page defines the transform bartorch computes, its accuracy and its conventions,
the difference between the adjoint, the density-compensated adjoint and a
reconstruction, the normal operator used by iterative solvers, and which
backend computes what.

## The transform

For an image $x$ of $N$ voxels and $M$ sample positions $k_j$, the forward
transform is

$$
y_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{m} x_m \, \exp\!\left(-2\pi i \sum_d \frac{k_{j,d}\, m_d}{n_d}\right),
\qquad j = 1, \dots, M,
$$

with $m$ the voxel index relative to the image centre
($m_d = -\lfloor n_d/2 \rfloor, \dots$ along each dimension $d$ of size $n_d$)
and $k_j$ in **grid units**: multiples of $1/\mathrm{FOV}$, so that a fully
sampled readout of $n$ samples spans $-n/2$ to $n/2$.  The adjoint has the
positive exponent and the same $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling.  A trajectory always has
three components; a $k_z$ that is zero throughout makes the transform
two-dimensional.

Evaluated directly the sum costs $O(NM)$.  A **non-uniform fast Fourier
transform** (NUFFT) computes it to a prescribed accuracy in
$O(N \log N + M)$.  The forward transform divides the image by the Fourier
transform of a compact kernel (**deapodization**), zero-pads it to a grid
oversampled by a factor $\sigma$, applies an FFT, and interpolates the grid onto
the sample positions with the kernel; the adjoint spreads the samples onto
that grid with the kernel, applies an inverse FFT, crops and
deapodizes.[^osullivan][^fessler2003][^beatty]
The kernel width and $\sigma$ determine the accuracy.

In bartorch the transform is computed by FINUFFT,[^finufft] whose forward
operator is its type-2 transform and whose adjoint is its type-1 transform.
FINUFFT is planned with a relative **tolerance** $\varepsilon$, from which it
chooses its kernel width.

| Setting | Default | Set by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tolerance $\varepsilon$ | $10^{-3}$; $10^{-6}$ for `ncalib` and `nlinv` | The kernel width: `width` of {class}`~bartorch.linop.NUFFT`, BART's `-w` option of the commands, converted to the tolerance that gives that width |
| Oversampling $\sigma$ | 1.25; 2 for `ncalib` and `nlinv` | `oversampling` of {class}`~bartorch.linop.NUFFT`, BART's `-o` option |

The relative error of a transform is of the order of $\varepsilon$; the test
suite compares it with the explicit sum above.  The default trades accuracy
for speed and memory, and is intended for reconstruction, where the error of
the transform is small compared with the errors caused by noise and
undersampling.  A comparison with an analytical reference or between
implementations needs a larger kernel width.  cuFINUFFT accepts $\sigma = 2$ and $\sigma = 1.25$ only.

## Adjoint, density compensation and reconstruction

| Estimate | Definition | Property |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adjoint | $\mathrm{NUFFT}^H y$ | Each sample is added onto the grid; regions sampled more densely are weighted more.  For radial sampling, which samples the k-space centre once per spoke, the result is the image weighted in k-space by the sampling density, approximately $1/\lvert k \rvert$, which blurs it |
| Density-compensated adjoint (gridding reconstruction) | $\mathrm{NUFFT}^H D y$, with $D$ a diagonal of weights $d_j \approx 1/\rho(k_j)$ | Approximately equalizes the sampling density $\rho$; for radial sampling $d_j \propto \lvert k_j \rvert$.  Unsampled regions of k-space remain missing, and undersampling appears as streaks |
| Reconstruction | Solution of the least-squares or regularized problem with $A$ | Consistent with the measured samples; needs no density compensation, which can serve as a weighting of the data term instead[^pipe][^pruessmann2001] |

{func}`bartorch.estimate_density` computes weights $d_j$ for a trajectory by
the fixed-point iteration of Pipe and Menon,[^pipe] with the convolutions
evaluated by the non-uniform transforms of this page.

Density weights passed to {class}`~bartorch.linop.NUFFT` or
{class}`~bartorch.linop.NoncartesianSense` become part of the operator,
$A = W\,\mathrm{NUFFT}\,S$: the weights are applied on the forward pass and
their conjugate on the adjoint, and the normal operator is built over them.
Weights $w_j = \sqrt{d_j}$ give $W^H W = D$.  Weights whose shape does not
broadcast onto the k-space samples are refused.

## The normal operator and the point spread function

An iterative solver applies $A^H A$.  The transform's own normal operator,
$Q = \mathrm{NUFFT}^H W^H W\,\mathrm{NUFFT}$, is a convolution of the image with
the **point spread function** (PSF)

$$
h(m) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_j \lvert w_j \rvert^2 \exp\!\left(2\pi i \sum_d \frac{k_{j,d}\, m_d}{n_d}\right),
$$

whose support spans twice the image extent.  $Q$ is therefore applied exactly
as a multiplication, in the Fourier domain of a grid doubled in each dimension,
by the **transfer function** $\hat{h}$, the FFT of $h$ on that grid: the image
is zero-padded to the doubled grid, transformed, multiplied, transformed back
and cropped.[^fessler2005]  With a subspace basis $h$ becomes a set of kernels
over pairs of coefficients.  The full SENSE normal operator
$\sum_c \overline{S_c}\, Q\, S_c$ is not a convolution, because the
sensitivities vary in space; {doc}`encoding` describes how it is applied.

$h$ is computed as the adjoint NUFFT of $\lvert w_j \rvert^2$ (of ones without
weights) onto the doubled grid, by FINUFFT, and BART stores $\hat{h}$ and
performs the multiplication.  BART's `--nufft-conf` selects how $\hat h$ is
stored:

| BART `--nufft-conf` | Storage of $\hat{h}$ |
| --- | --- |
| default, `lowmem`, `no-precomp` | The complete complex array |
| `decomposed-psf` | $2^d$ grids of the image size, one at a time |
| `upper-triag-psf` | Half of the Hermitian kernel matrix of a subspace basis |
| `real-psf` | The real part |
| `compress-psf` | The entries within the trajectory's footprint, and their indices |

One application of this normal operator costs two FFTs of the doubled grid per
coil and one multiplication; the alternative, a forward and an adjoint NUFFT,
spreads and interpolates every sample of every coil.  `toeplitz=False` on an
operator, or BART's `pics --no-toeplitz`, selects the two transforms instead.
The two forms differ by an amount of the order of the transform's tolerance,
as {doc}`../auto_examples/02-non-cartesian/01-trajectories-and-transforms`
measures.

## Backends and refusals

Every non-uniform transform is computed by FINUFFT or cuFINUFFT; BART's own
gridding implementation is not used, and no configuration falls back to it.

| Path | Backend | Device | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forward and adjoint transform, PSF | FINUFFT | CPU | Compiled into every build |
| Forward and adjoint transform, PSF | cuFINUFFT | CUDA | Compiled into the CUDA build |
| Multiplication by $\hat h$ | BART, with the FFT of the device: MKL or pocketfft on the host, cuFFT on a CUDA device | Either | — |
| Unsupported configuration | None | Either | {class}`~bartorch.BartError` naming the reason: weights whose shape does not broadcast onto the k-space samples, an image that varies along an axis the trajectory indexes in a BART command, a kernel width no tolerance produces, among others |

The backend of a transform is chosen by where its arguments are, not by where
the trajectory is: an operator holds one pair of plans per memory space and
builds each the first time a transform is requested there.

## Trajectories

{func}`bartorch.tools.traj` generates trajectories in grid units.  A radial
trajectory with successive spokes separated by $\pi/n_s$ covers k-space
uniformly for a frame of exactly $n_s$ spokes.  With **golden-angle**
ordering, successive spokes are separated by $\pi$ times the reciprocal of
the golden ratio, about $111.25°$, and any number of consecutive spokes covers
k-space approximately uniformly.[^winkelmann]  A continuously acquired
golden-angle series can therefore be divided into frames after the
acquisition, as {doc}`../auto_examples/03-applications/01-dynamic-golden-angle`
does.
