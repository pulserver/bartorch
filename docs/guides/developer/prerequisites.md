# Development prerequisites

| Tool | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Git | With submodule support; BART is the submodule `external/bart` |
| Python | 3.10 or later, with PyTorch installed first as described in {doc}`../user/installation` |
| C and C++ compiler | clang, or GCC 14 or later.  BART's nested functions are compiled as Blocks by clang and as heap trampolines (`-ftrampoline-impl=heap`) by GCC 14; CMake rejects older GCC at configuration |
| CMake | 3.18 or later, with Ninja or Make |
| OpenMP | The runtime matching the compiler, for example `libomp-dev` with clang on Debian and Ubuntu.  Without it the build succeeds and runs single-threaded |
| CUDA (optional) | A CUDA toolkit with `nvcc` for `-DBARTORCH_CUDA=ON`; a CUDA build of PyTorch does not include a compiler |

FINUFFT is a runtime dependency that `pip install -e .` installs.  When the
suite is run from `src/` without installing, install it separately
(`pip install finufft`): without it the non-Cartesian tests fail rather than
skip, because the substitution declining is an error.  `pip install mkl
deepinv` enables the tests that need MKL and the DeepInverse adapter.

On Windows the compiler is clang from MSYS2's CLANG64 environment, with the
packages `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{clang,cmake,ninja,openmp,llvm-tools}`,
`clang64/bin` on `PATH` and `CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja`.  The build links against
the OpenMP runtime PyTorch installs rather than MSYS2's, and loads into the
official CPython with nothing from MSYS2 at run time.  There is no CUDA build on
Windows.
