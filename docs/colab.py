"""Open each gallery example in Google Colab, from a notebook that installs what it needs.

Colab opens a notebook from a GitHub repository, so the notebooks it opens are
copies published with the site on the ``gh-pages`` branch, under
``<version>/_colab/``.  Each copy is the notebook sphinx-gallery writes for the
example, with two cells in front of it: a note, and a ``%pip install`` of
bartorch and the packages the example imports.  The notebooks the example
pages offer for download are left as sphinx-gallery writes them.

``badge`` is the reStructuredText each example page carries under its title,
and ``write`` puts the copies into the built site.
