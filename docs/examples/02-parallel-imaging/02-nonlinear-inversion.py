Nonlinear inversion
===================

This lesson reconstructs an image and the coil sensitivities together from
undersampled data whose fully sampled central region is too small for a
separate calibration, and then writes the same reconstruction out as a
nonlinear operator and a Gauss-Newton solver.

ESPIRiT [#espirit]_ estimates the sensitivities from the autocalibration
(ACS) region at the centre of k-space, and a linear SENSE reconstruction then
treats them as known. When the ACS region is small, or absent, as in many
real-time, non-Cartesian and highly accelerated protocols, the sensitivities
are unknowns like the image, and the forward model

.. math::

   y_c = P F (S_c \\cdot x)

becomes bilinear: it is a product of two unknowns. Nonlinear inversion
(NLINV) [#nlinv]_ solves it by the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton
method (IRGNM) [#bakushinsky]_, with the smoothness of the sensitivities, which
resolves the ambiguity of the factorization, built into the model as a
weighting of their k-space coefficients rather than added as a penalty.

The phantom and the coil sensitivities are built as in
:doc:`../01-basics/02-from-kspace-to-image`; the cell that does it is hidden on
this page and present in the script this page can be downloaded as.

**Learning objectives**

- Reconstruct an image and its sensitivities jointly with
  :func:`bartorch.tools.nlinv` from an ACS region too small for ESPIRiT.
- State the ambiguity of the bilinear factorization and the role of the
  Sobolev weighting of the sensitivities.
- Write the same reconstruction as :class:`bartorch.nlop.NonlinearSense`
  under :class:`bartorch.nlop.IRGNM`.

It follows :doc:`01-coil-calibration`, which used ``nlinv`` as a calibration
step. The next lesson, :doc:`03-noise-prewhitening`, turns to the noise model
of the receive channels.

#
# From a third of the phase encodes and six central lines, nonlinear inversion
# removes the aliasing of the zero-filled image; its error is concentrated at
# tissue boundaries and in the noise-like residue of the random sampling.
#
# The estimated sensitivities are smooth by construction rather than by
# agreement with the data: the coil unknown is not the sensitivity map but its
# k-space representation :math:`\hat{s}`, and the map follows as
# :math:`S = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[(1 + a|k|^2)^{-b/2} \hat{s}]`, a Sobolev-norm
# weighting that suppresses high spatial frequencies. A Gauss-Newton step in
# the unknown is therefore a smooth change of the map, and the joint problem
# needs no separate penalty on the coils.
#
# The pair is determined only up to a common factor: multiplying every map by
# a nonzero function :math:`\gamma(r)` and dividing the image by it leaves the
# data unchanged (:doc:`../../explanation/nonlinear`). The weighting restricts
# :math:`\gamma` to smooth functions, so the estimated maps match the
# simulated ones up to a smooth common magnitude and phase. The figures above
# therefore show the estimated maps inside the head, divided by their root sum
# of squares and with the phase of channel 0 subtracted, which removes that
# factor; so normalized, they reproduce the simulated maps. An ``nlinv`` image
# is reported after multiplication by the root sum of squares of the maps.
# Outside the object neither factor is determined at all -- their product is
# zero for any pair -- so the maps there follow from the initialization and
# the weighting.
#
# The model and the solver
# ------------------------
#
# :class:`bartorch.nlop.NonlinearSense` is that forward model as a nonlinear
# operator with two inputs, the image and the coil coefficients, and
# :class:`bartorch.nlop.IRGNM` is the Gauss-Newton loop over it. Each step
# linearizes the model at the current estimate :math:`x_k` and solves
#
# .. math::
#
#    \min_x \, \| DF_{x_k} (x - x_k) - (y - F(x_k)) \|^2
#    + \alpha_k \| x - x_{\mathrm{ref}} \|^2,
#
# with :math:`DF_{x_k}` the derivative of the forward model,
# :math:`x_{\mathrm{ref}}` zero unless one is given, and :math:`\alpha_k`
# halved after every step, so the first steps are heavily regularized and the
# later ones are not.

    (COILS, 1, SIZE, SIZE), pattern=lines.reshape(1, SIZE, 1).to(torch.complex64)

# %%
#
# ``nlinv`` scales the data by ``100 / ||y||`` before it starts, which fixes
# the meaning of :math:`\alpha`, and runs the conjugate gradients of each step
# to a hundred iterations or a relative tolerance of a tenth. Given the same
# three settings, the loop written here is the application.

# %%
#
# The two agree to single-precision round-off rather than to the last bit,
# because the data scaling is computed here and inside the application by
# different expressions.
#
# What the operator form adds is access to everything around the step. The
# linearized problem can go to a solver from :mod:`bartorch.optim` instead of
# the conjugate gradients inside the library (``inner=optim.CG()`` is the same
# method written out, and a regularized solver makes the step a regularized
# one), the loop can be unrolled as :class:`bartorch.nlop.IRGNMBlock`, and a
# Gauss-Newton step is differentiable with respect to the data, the iterate,
# the regularization centre and :math:`\alpha`
# (:doc:`../../explanation/differentiation`).
#
# Reconstructing parameter maps rather than an image, by putting a signal model
# in front of the same encoding, is :doc:`../05-model-based/02-quantitative-models`.
