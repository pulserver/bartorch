Tours
-----

Corrections applied to the data before reconstruction or to the image after
it, each shown on its own and independent of the course: removal of readout
oversampling and apodization, EPI Nyquist-ghost correction and regridding of
ramp-sampled readouts, receive bias-field correction, correction of the
geometric distortion caused by gradient nonlinearity, off-resonance deblurring
of spiral images, and rigid head-motion tracking from navigators.  Each tour
simulates the artefact from a known ground truth, so that the correction is
evaluated against it.

The first tour removes readout oversampling and compares Fermi and Hann
apodization by their Gibbs ringing and resolution. The second corrects the
Nyquist ghost of an EPI train from a three-line navigator and resamples a
ramp-sampled readout. The third estimates the receive bias field of a head
array with N4. The fourth corrects the geometric distortion and intensity
error of gradient nonlinearity from the coil's spherical-harmonic
coefficients. The fifth deblurs a spiral image off resonance by
multifrequency interpolation and by a time-segmented reconstruction. The
sixth measures rigid head motion from three orthogonal navigator planes and
filters it across a scan. The seventh corrects the susceptibility distortion
of an EPI image from a reversed phase-encoding pair.
