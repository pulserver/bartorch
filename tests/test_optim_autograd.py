"""The solve inside a network: what carries a gradient, and what that gradient is.

Every operator application in :mod:`bartorch` is already recorded for autograd,
so an iteration assembled out of applications, axpys and a proximal operator is
a torch graph over BART's arithmetic.  The one thing that was not was the
linear solve: conjugate gradients runs inside the library and hands back an
array with no history.

It is now, by implicit differentiation -- ``x = N^-1 A^H y`` is linear in ``y``,
so the backward pass is one more solve with the same operator.  That is what
BART does for the one solver it made an ``nlop``: ``norm_inv_der_src`` and
``norm_inv_adj_src`` in ``src/nlops/norm_inv.c`` each run a conjugate-gradient
solve of their own rather than unrolling the forward one.

The consequence worth stating is that the recorded gradient is the derivative
of the *solution*, not of the truncated iteration that approximated it.  With
the solve converged the two are the same thing, and
``test_the_gradient_is_the_solves_and_not_the_iterations_it_took`` is what says
so where they are not.
