"""The nonlinear MRI encodings: the image and the coils fitted together.

BART's ``noir`` model is what ``nlinv`` inverts, so the test that matters is
that a fit driven from here and one driven by ``nlinv`` are the same
arithmetic.  On a grid they are, to the last bit.

Off the grid they are not, and comparing them there is not a test.  The
transform underneath is FINUFFT rather than BART's own gridding, and two
Gauss-Newton runs that start together drift apart as the steps accumulate: on
one machine they agree to 7e-4 after two steps and to 6e-3 after twelve, and
on another the same comparison fails at four.  What is being measured there is
how far two numerical paths have diverged, which is not a property of the
model.

So off the grid what is held is what does not depend on a path: that the
model's output is the composition it claims to be, and that a fit converges
towards the image it was made from.  How *far* twelve steps get is a path too
-- the inner conjugate gradients stops on a relative residual, so the last
bits decide how many iterations a step takes -- so what is asserted is the
direction and a bound loose enough for the slowest machine seen.
