"""Commands whose output BART marks optional, and the two that need it anyway.

A derived wrapper asks for as many output arrays as BART requires, and ten
commands require none.  For eight of them that is right: they print their
answer and write a file only when given a name, through ``anon_cfl`` or behind
an ``if``.  ``morphop`` creates it unguarded (``morphop.c:77``), and
``create_cfl`` hands the name to ``io_unlink_if_opened``, which calls
``strcmp`` on it: with no name that is a segmentation fault, which takes the
process rather than raising.  ``raga`` refuses an omitted name unless it is
asked to print a search instead.
