"""What a BART option is called in Python, and what it reaches on the way out.

The flag is looked up in the catalogue rather than derived from the keyword,
because BART writes some long names with hyphens and others with underscores
and no rule over the keyword can be right for both.  Deriving it is what made
``pics(psf_export=...)`` send ``--psf-export``, which BART rejects.
