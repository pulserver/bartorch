"""The catalogue is what BART's sources say, and stays that way.

``src/bartorch/_catalogue.py`` is generated from the BART submodule.  It
is a description of BART rather than a Python API on purpose: the wrappers
people call are written by hand against it, so a name in Python is chosen
rather than transliterated, and a command nobody has wrapped is still
countable.

What is checked here is that it is current, that it covers every tool BART
builds, and that it keeps the things a straight transliteration of the command
line throws away -- which is most of why it exists.
