"""The seam between the header and ctypes.

``src/bartorch/_abi.py`` is generated from ``src/csrc/include/bartorch.h``.  A
signature written twice is a signature that drifts, and a wrong one is a
silently truncated pointer rather than an error, so what is checked here is
that the generated file is still what the header produces and that every entry
point the header exports has a signature at all.
