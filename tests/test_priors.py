"""The regularization terms, applied on their own.

A term is BART's: ``opt_reg_configure`` turns it into a proximal operator and,
for some of them, a transform to apply it through.  Handing the pair to a
solver is what ``pics`` does, and what :mod:`bartorch.optim` did until now --
which meant a term could not be evaluated at all outside a solve.

It can now, and the claim is that it is the same operator: BART's own IST,
written out here around ``Regularizer.prox``, is the solver's answer to the
bit.
