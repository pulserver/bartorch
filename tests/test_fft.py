"""BART's FFT, and the two transforms that serve it.

BART plans through the FFTW guru interface: a set of transformed dimensions
and a set of dimensions to loop over, each with its own strides.  MKL takes
the transformed axes and one loop axis, and the loop axes left over are walked
by the library.  That walk is the part worth testing, because a wrong stride
in it is not a crash but a quietly rearranged image.

The two implementations are held against each other and both against numpy, so
neither a shared convention nor a shared mistake can pass.
